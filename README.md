# SQL DATABASE FOR FIRST GENERATION POKÃ‰MON

## Author: Samuel Champer

An SQL database for first generation pokemon and for game assets for a fictional, simplified pokemon game, as well as a web page that conducts live querries of the database to answer some burning questions you might have about the relative merits of the pokemon in question.

The project was previously hosted live at http://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~schampe2/pokemonDB/index.html.
